## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document created for the discipline of Scientific Methodology and Performance Evaluation for Computer Scientists, Porto Alegre, October 2020.

This work will present a data visualization of the dataset vgsales.cls from https://www.kaggle.com/kedokedokedo/vgsales. The packages "knitr" and "ggplot2" are used.

We start by presenting the summary and the structure of the dataset:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Packages 
#For kable
library(knitr) 
#For ggplot
library("ggplot2")

#Loading Data
myCsv <- read.csv("vgsales.csv")

#Showing resumes
summary(myCsv)
str(myCsv)

```

As shown, the file has 16598 rows/games with 11 columns/variables. 

The 11 variables are the following:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Get the columns names of the dataset
names <- names(myCsv)
names
```

We will focus our analysis on the following variables:

- Platform

- Year

- Genre

- Global_Sales

## Most and Least Sold Games

The 5 games which were sold the most:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Focus: numbers represent the columns we will focus - Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Global_Sales
focus <- c(2,3,4,5,11)

#Heads: present the first 5 games in the dataset
heads <- head(myCsv, 5)
kable(heads[focus], row.names = FALSE)
```

And the 5 which were sold the least:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Tails: Present the last 5
tails <- tail(myCsv, 5)
kable(tails[focus], row.names = FALSE)
```


## Platform Analysis

Analysing the Global_Sales vs Platform data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Barplot Global_Sales vs Platform, stat="identity" sums the values occurrences, the theme its to angle the names in the plot
ggplot(myCsv, aes(Platform, Global_Sales)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.5, fill="tomato3") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6))
```

We can see that the platforms with more sales are:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Count global Sales per platform
platGlobalSales <- c( sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Platform == "PS2"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Platform == "X360"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Platform == "PS3"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Platform == "Wii"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Platform == "DS"), "Global_Sales"])
                    )

#Count number of games per platform
platNumberOGames <- c( sum(myCsv$Platform == "PS2"), sum(myCsv$Platform == "X360"), sum(myCsv$Platform == "PS3"), sum(myCsv$Platform == "Wii"), sum(myCsv$Platform == "DS"))

platSalesPerGames <- platGlobalSales / platNumberOGames

#Creating dataset to print
platform5 <- data.frame("Platform" = c("PS2", "X360", "PS3", "Wii", "DS"),
                        "Global_Sales" = platGlobalSales,
                        "Number_of_Games" = platNumberOGames,
                        "Sales_per_Game" = platSalesPerGames
                        )
#Printing
kable(platform5, align = "lc")
```

Which is a interesting result, as one would believe that the platform with more sales would be Wii ( because 3 of the top 5 games sold were from the Wii).


## Year Analysis

Analysing the Global_Sales vs Year data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Barplot Global Sales vs Year
ggplot(myCsv, aes(Year, Global_Sales)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.5, fill="steelblue3") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6))
```

We can see that the years with more sales are:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
yearGlobalSales <- c( sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Year == "2008"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Year == "2009"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Year == "2007"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Year == "2010"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Year == "2006"), "Global_Sales"])
                      )

yearNumberOGames <- c( sum(myCsv$Year == "2008"), sum(myCsv$Year == "2009"), sum(myCsv$Year == "2007"), sum(myCsv$Year == "2010"), sum(myCsv$Year == "2006"))

year5 <- data.frame("Year" = c("2008", "2009", "2007", "2010", "2006"),
                        "Global_Sales" = yearGlobalSales,
                        "Number_of_Games" = yearNumberOGames
                        )

kable(year5, align = "lc")
```

This data is related to the platform as well:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(myCsv, aes(Year, Global_Sales)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.5, aes(fill=Platform)) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6))
```

We can see that the increase in the sales from to 2006 to 2010 are distributed pretty even between the platforms with most sales.


## Genre Analysis

Analysing the Global_Sales vs Genre data:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(myCsv, aes(Genre, Global_Sales)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.5, fill="palegreen3") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6))

#Pie Chart, takes time to compile
#ggplot(myCsv, aes(x="", y=Global_Sales, fill=Genre))+ geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") + coord_polar("y", start=0) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") + theme_minimal()

```

The genres which sold the most were:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
genreGlobalSales <- c( sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Genre == "Action"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Genre == "Sports"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Genre == "Shooter"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Genre == "Role-Playing"), "Global_Sales"]),
                      sum(myCsv[which(myCsv$Genre == "Platform"), "Global_Sales"])
                      )

genreNumberOGames <- c( sum(myCsv$Genre == "Action"), sum(myCsv$Genre == "Sports"), sum(myCsv$Genre == "Shooter"), sum(myCsv$Genre == "Role-Playing"), sum(myCsv$Genre == "Platform"))

genre5 <- data.frame("Genre" = c("Action", "Sports", "Shooter", "Role-Playing", "Platform"),
                        "Global_Sales" = genreGlobalSales,
                        "Number_of_Games" = genreNumberOGames
                        )

kable(genre5, align = "lc")
```

Analysing the Global_Sales vs Genre per Platform:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Facet_Wrap show mini Global Sales vs Genre graphs for each platform
ggplot(myCsv, aes(Genre, Global_Sales)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", width=.5, fill="palegreen3") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=65, vjust=0.6)) + facet_wrap(~Platform)
```

The genres with more sales by platform are:

- PS2: Action, Sports

- X360: Shooter, Action

- PS3: Action, Shooter

- Wii: Sports, Misc

- DS: Simulation, Role-Playing
